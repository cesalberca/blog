In the crazy world of the frontend it has been known by its **volatile nature**, however, we don't really put much effort to abstract ourselves from that nature. We should build **robust** and **long-lived** code. In this talk we'll see how to approach common problems using **TypeScript**, **components** and **several design patterns**. Moreover, we'll see how to make our code _open to change_ without needing to _try to guess the future_. And of course we'll follow **SOLID** principles to make your application easy to change and test. Let's start this journey towards _beautiful_ software!
