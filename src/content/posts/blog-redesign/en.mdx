  summary: 'After quitting my job, I decided to redesign my blog. This is the story of how I did it (the blog).',
}

I recently became a **Freelancer and Digital Nomad traveling the world**. This kilometerstone could only be celebrated by **redesigning my blog**.

> You are not a true Web Developer if you don't redesign your blog every year.

Being a freelancer means that I not only need to be technically proficient, but also need to think about how I can **effectively communicate** what I offer so people will want to book my services.

A powerful way of conveying your message—whatever that might be—is to make sure the **medium in which your message is transmitted is attractive enough**. Designing is something that we humans do quite often: we design our outfits, we design how we talk, and as a web designer, I designed and built this very same site you are experiencing.

## Technologies

Technology _needs_ to serve a purpose. Sometimes—most times, let's be honest—we web developers focus too much on the technologies and frameworks we use. We should talk about them, be proud of what we use, and maybe even poke fun at others' choices, but only to a _certain_ extent. Here, I'm mentioning some of the technologies I've used, what I've learned from them, and how they've empowered me to focus on what really matters: **the message**.

A good starting point is to use starters. I used the [Next.js starter portfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit). It provided me with some initial configuration for SEO, so I wouldn't have to worry about it (for now). For instance, it included `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, `rss/route.ts`, and `og/route.ts`.

When using a starter, what I do is generate the template in a temporary folder and then choose what to copy over to my project. This ensures that I don't take more than I need and that I can check exactly what I want to bring over.

I also configured the project as I usually do, with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), and [Lint Staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged). How I configure the projects I work on could definitely be another post at some point.

I made a conscious—perhaps also debatable—choice not to delve too deep into **best practices**, **testing**, and **architecture**. _Why_? Because I want to create a blog series where I can improve the codebase bit by _byte_. But hey, it's not like I coded the _thing_ with my eyes closed (which could be an interesting challenge, to be honest). You can check the source code [here](https://github.com/cesalberca/blog/tree/6037908cf67122706665b3d8c00590bd0a5f5040) at the time of publishing this post. I think it's pretty neat.

What I decided to focus on instead was creating a clean design with a big focus on content and some subtle animations that would make the site b·e·a·u·t·i·f·u·l. Here are some:

<div className="grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-6">
  <h3>Animations</h3>
  <div className="flex flex-col">
    <div>
      <NavLink href="#">Navbar link (hover over me!)</NavLink>
    </div>
    <div>
      <AccentText repeat>Accent text</AccentText>
    </div>
    <div>
      <AccentList texts={['One', 'Two', 'Forty two']}></AccentList>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div>
      <div><Background>
        <div className="p-xl">Background (more hover!)</div>
      </Background></div>

      <div><Background image="/assets/images/posts/blog-redesign/medusa.jpg">
        <div className="p-xl">Background with image (still hover!)</div>
      </Background></div>

      <div><AccentCard className="flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="p-xl">3D card (you guessed it, hover!)</div>
      </AccentCard>

    </div>

  </div>
</div>

I'm always on the lookout for inspiration. Seeing how others have tackled similar problems reassures me that I'm not alone in my quest for _my solution_. Some great places I <del>stole ideas from</del> looked for inspiration were [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).

## MDX

As you can see, all the components I'm developing for the website can be reused in blog posts, and that's thanks to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX is like Markdown on Kombucha (meaning _super powerful_). Why? Because in **MDX, you can import React components**, which is a crazy thing to do.

```mdx
**Foo**

<Background>
  <div className="p-xl">Bar</div>
</Background>

> Baz
```

Which will render this:

**Foo**

<Background>
  <div className="p-xl">Bar</div>
</Background>

> Baz

Cool, right?

Next.js comes with support for MDX using some extra libraries. I started configuring the project following the [Next.js MDX guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx), which at some point suggests using [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote). I found it a little cumbersome and noticed that it provided some functionality I don't really need (_YAGNI_).

After searching for simpler solutions, I stumbled upon [this fantastic post](https://www.alexchantastic.com/building-a-blog-with-next-and-mdx), which showed how to simplify the setup using just [next-mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx).

The only thing I still need to figure out is how to generate SEO-compliant metadata for each article and talk. But that will be another `POST`.

The structure for the posts is quite simple. We just tell Next.js, "please, render `.mdx` files when asked to":

```typescript
import withMDX from '@next/mdx'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
}

export default withMDX()(nextConfig)
```

And then it's a matter of specifying in what route would the post be rendered.

```text
src/
└── app/
    └── blog/
        └── (posts)/
            └── blog-redesign/
                └── page.mdx
```

Since we want to customize the components that MDX renders, we can create a file under `src` called `mdx-components` to do so:

```tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'

import Link from 'next/link'
import {
  type ComponentProps,
  createElement,
  type LinkHTMLAttributes,
  type PropsWithChildren,
  type ReactNode,
} from 'react'
import { Prism as SyntaxHighlighter } from 'react-syntax-highlighter'
import dark from 'react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/prism/synthwave84'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

function CustomLink(props: LinkHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement> & PropsWithChildren<{ href: string }>) {
  let href = props.href

  if (href.startsWith('/')) {
    return <Link {...props}>{props.children}</Link>
  }

  if (href.startsWith('#')) {
    return <a {...props} />
  }

  return <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" {...props} />
}

function Code({ children, ...props }: { children: string; className: string }) {
  const className = props?.className ?? ''
  const match = /language-(\w+)/.exec(className ?? '')
  return match ? (
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      {...props}
      language={match[1]}
      PreTag="div"
      style={dark}
      codeTagProps={{
        style: {
          fontFamily:
            'ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace',
        },
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
  ) : (
    <code
      {...props}
      className={cn(className, 'bg-muted px-[4px] py-[2px] mx-[2px] rounded not-prose text-base font-mono')}
    >
      {children}
    </code>
  )
}

function slugify(str: string) {
  return str
    .toString()
    .toLowerCase()
    .trim() // Remove whitespace from both ends of a string
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-') // Replace spaces with -
    .replace(/&/g, '-and-') // Replace & with 'and'
    .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, '') // Remove all non-word characters except for -
    .replace(/\-\-+/g, '-') // Replace multiple - with single -
}

function createHeading(level: number) {
  const Heading = ({ children }: { children: string }) => {
    const slug = slugify(children)
    return createElement(
      `h${level}`,
      { id: slug },
      [
        createElement('a', {
          href: `#${slug}`,
          key: `link-${slug}`,
          className: 'anchor',
        }),
      ],
      children,
    )
  }

  Heading.displayName = `Heading${level}`

  return Heading
}

const customComponents: ComponentProps<any>['components'] = {
  h1: createHeading(1),
  h2: createHeading(2),
  h3: createHeading(3),
  h4: createHeading(4),
  h5: createHeading(5),
  h6: createHeading(6),
  a: CustomLink,
  code: Code,
  pre: ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => <pre className="p-0 font-mono">{children}</pre>,
}

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...customComponents,
    ...components,
  }
}
```

Each article should also have the same layout as the website. To achieve this, you can export a default function that uses a custom component. I would have liked it if this were integrated into the Next.js layout system. Maybe in the future?

```tsx

import { PostLayout } from '@/features/posts/delivery/post-layout'

# My blog content

export default function Page({ children }) {
  return <PostLayout slug="blog-redesign">{children}</PostLayout>
}
```

The `PostLayout` component has the following content:

```tsx
import { Page } from '@/core/components/page/page'
import type { ReactNode } from 'react'
import { PostPage } from '@/features/posts/delivery/post.page'
import type { PostMetadata } from '@/post-metadata'

export async function PostLayout({ children, slug }: { children: ReactNode; slug: string }) {
  const { metadata } = (await import(`./(posts)/${slug}/page.mdx`)) as { metadata: PostMetadata }

  return (
    <Page top>
      <PostPage metadata={metadata} slug={slug}>
        {children}
      </PostPage>
    </Page>
  )
}
```

There's some metadata in each article that is used to generate the SEO metadata. This metadata is exported as a `const`. For example, the metadata for this very article is:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  slug: 'blog-redesign',
  title: 'Blog Redesign',
  date: '2024-08-25',
  image: 'blog-redesign/medusa.jpg',
  categories: ['software-development', 'branding', 'design'],
  readTime: 15,
  summary: 'After quitting my job, I decided to redesign my blog. This is the story of how I did it.',
}
```

This removes the need of adding `front-matter` and a subsequent parser. **Simpler is better**.

## TaildwindCSS

In case you missed it, there's some code that might initially look **aberrant**. If so, it's because you haven't tried _yet_ [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):

```tsx
<code {...props} className={cn(className, 'bg-muted px-[4px] py-[2px] mx-[2px] rounded not-prose text-base font-mono')}>
  {children}
</code>
```

To me, CSS is part of the front-end architecture, and it's something I don't overlook nor hate. I wanted to incorporate TailwindCSS to see if it's scalable and provides a good framework for development. Conclusion: **it does**.

However, there are two changes I made:

1. Use named spacing units instead of arbitrary numbers.
2. Use theme-oriented names instead of specific colors.

It's important to me to abstract the spacing units. I don't want to use numbers such as `p-2`, `m-8`, or `w-4`. Instead, I prefer using `p-s`, `m-m`, or `w-xl`. This way, I can change the spacing units in one place, and it will be reflected throughout the entire project.

The same goes for colors. You typically won't see specific colors in the code (unless I want to invariably use a particular color). Instead, you'll see `text-primary`, `bg-secondary`, `border-destructive`, etc. This approach provides more flexibility and maintainability to the project, especially if you want to change the primary color down the line.

```typescript
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

const config = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      spacing: {
        xxs: '8px',
        xs: '12px',
        s: '16px',
        m: '24px',
        l: '32px',
        xl: '48px',
        xxl: '56px',
      },
      colors: {
        border: 'hsl(var(--border))',
        input: 'hsl(var(--input))',
        ring: 'hsl(var(--ring))',
        background: 'hsl(var(--background))',
        foreground: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--primary))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--primary-foreground))',
        },
        secondary: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--secondary))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--secondary-foreground))',
        },
        destructive: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--destructive))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--destructive-foreground))',
        },
        muted: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--muted))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--muted-foreground))',
        },
        accent: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--accent))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--accent-foreground))',
        },
        popover: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--popover))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--popover-foreground))',
        },
        card: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--card))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--card-foreground))',
        },
      },
    },
  },
} satisfies Config

export default config
```

## ShadcnUI

ShadcnUI introduces a concept that might initially make us shudder in fear: copying and pasting code. It does this by generating code for your components. But why would I want that? Well, it serves as a base for lightweight components, and from there, I can customize them as much as I want. The code is _mine_ after all.

Whenever I need a new component, I head [over to their documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) and find the component I need. Then, I generate it using the CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

The button will be generated in `src/components/ui/button.tsx` and will look something like this:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { Slot } from '@radix-ui/react-slot'
import { cva, type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority'

import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

const buttonVariants = cva(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90',
        destructive: 'bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90',
        outline: 'border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground',
        secondary: 'bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80',
        ghost: 'hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground',
        link: 'text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline',
      },
      size: {
        default: 'h-10 px-4 py-2',
        sm: 'h-9 rounded-md px-3',
        lg: 'h-11 rounded-md px-8',
        icon: 'h-10 w-10',
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'default',
      size: 'default',
    },
  },
)

export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  asChild?: boolean
}

const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
    const Comp = asChild ? Slot : 'button'
    return <Comp className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))} ref={ref} {...props} />
  },
)
Button.displayName = 'Button'

export { Button, buttonVariants }
```

As you can see, it uses TailwindCSS and RadixUI under the hood to do all the heavy lifting. `class-variance-authority` is a library that makes it easy to create variants of a component.

Another reason I chose ShadcnUI is its integration with Vercel's new AI tool to generate pieces of UI: [v0](https://v0.dev/). Is web design already doomed? Well, when wasn't it?

## What's Next?

I <del>need</del> want to get back to blog writing, covering everything from technical topics to more personal stories. I want to share my projects, my experiences as a Digital Nomad, and even the recipe I use to make my deodorant. My goal is to create a site that I cherish visiting and enjoy reading. And if you do too, well, that would be amazing!
