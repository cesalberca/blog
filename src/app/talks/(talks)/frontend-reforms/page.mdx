Aren't you tired that they ask you to create clean code but no one has told you what it really is? Aren't you sick that in talks of good practices they don't show you how to address the refactors that will improve your application? If that's the case, this is your talk. We will "reform" a frontend application, where little by little we will make it more legible and maintainable in a very simple and practical way. Don't miss it!
