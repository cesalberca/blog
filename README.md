# Why This Blog Is Now Closed Source

**This repository is no longer public**. The full explanation is available in the accompanying article:
https://cesalberca.com/blog/why-am-i-close-sourcing-my-website

Below is a direct summary of the reasons and the philosophy behind this decision.

## Focus and publishing velocity

The blog runs on MDX, and all posts including drafts live inside the codebase. Keeping the repository private preserves control over when ideas are ready to be shared. Any separation of drafts into other repositories would add overhead and slow down publishing.

## Avoiding full-site clones

Open sourcing the entire site makes it easy for someone to fork it, change a logo, and publish a near-identical version. The goal is to inspire thoughtful adaptation of individual ideas, not enable one-click duplication of the whole platform.

## Security and cost management

The site includes dynamic features and server endpoints. Exposing implementation details increases the risk of targeted abuse and can create unnecessary costs, especially when third-party services charge per request. Keeping the code private reduces both risk and unpredictability.

# Knowledge stays open

The site being closed source does not mean knowledge becomes closed. Instead of exposing the entire repo, the plan is to publish focused, high-quality writeups on topics such as frontend architecture, MDX workflows, and building newsletters with React Email and Resend. These deep dives offer clearer value than simply browsing the entire codebase.

You can still learn from and explore the site through:

# Closing

Open source has shaped this career, and contributions continue through articles, examples, talks, and shared ideas. For this specific project, privacy enables better writing, safer operations, and more sustainable maintenance.
