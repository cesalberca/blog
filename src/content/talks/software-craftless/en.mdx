    "This is a fun and sarcastic talk where I give specific tips and examples on how to create bad Software. It's a satire, so during all the talk I'm serious. It's an easy-going talk where I mix comedy and programming to teach some valuable lessons.",

Most talks show you how to write clean and maintainable code. This one doesn’t. Here, you’ll learn how to write code that confuses, misleads, and breaks things in unexpected ways—on purpose.

Discover how to:
*	Hide bugs so well even you can’t find them
*	Create features that crash when looked at wrong
*	Design programs that only work on your machine

This is not lazy coding—it’s chaotic brilliance. Together, we’ll craft code so twisted it makes a goat vomit. 🐐🤮
