## We're Building for More Than Just Humans

Today's software architecture must support both human creativity and machine collaboration.

As software engineering enters the age of AI-assisted development, the demands on software architecture are changing. Tools like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [V0.dev](https://v0.dev/), and intelligent IDE agents like [Junie](https://junie.io/) are reshaping how interfaces are built. But code quality, scalability, and maintainability remain non-negotiable.

So, how do we design systems that are both **AI-enhanced** and **AI-controllable**?

This article explores an end-to-end architecture that integrates:

- **AI Guidelines** - A file describing the conventions and rules that AI IDE agents should follow when generating code
- **AI-assisted UI generation** - Using AI to create and refine interface components
- **Design systems with code-first foundations** - Building component libraries that both humans and AI can
understand
- **Custom registries and AI-integrated component libraries** - Organizing code in ways that AI tools can effectively navigate
- **Use case-driven logic** - Creating predictable patterns for AI to follow
- **Middleware chains for application scalability** - Implementing flexible, composable application logic

## 1. Development Conventions for AI Interpretation

Context is a fundamental aspect of working effectively with AI. Without it, the quality of AI-generated results drops significantly. To save time and avoid repeating instructions on how we want code to be generated, AI-IDE integrations offer a way to define and persist a shared context.

After trying [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) for a while, I switched back to the JetBrains suite once [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) was released. While it’s not the fastest code generator, it produces high-quality code that follows best practices—and that’s what matters most to me. Plus, it’s seamlessly integrated into my IDE of choice: WebStorm.

You can create a `guidelines.md` file in your project in the folder `.junie` which will provide machine-readable guidelines:

```
Framework: Next.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
Language: TypeScript
Tests: Vitest + Playwright

Architecture:
- Use Case pattern
- CQRS
- Middleware chaining

Standards:
- Named exports only
- No enums, use unions
- One component per file
- ?? instead of ||
- Avoid unnecessary useEffect
- FC with PropsWithChildren
```

This eliminates friction and accelerates development.

## 2. Component-Driven UI with AI Integration

AI tools like [V0.dev](https://v0.dev/) are redefining the prototyping phase. Instead of drawing wireframes or writing full boilerplate, developers can:

- Describe a UI in natural language
- Receive fully composed JSX using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Modify and commit directly to the Github Repository

For example, a prompt like "Create a dark mode signup form with two input fields and a CTA button" results in valid, accessible JSX using base components that are being imported from `@/components/ui`, which is the default for Shadcn:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"

export default function Component() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-950 flex items-center justify-center p-4">
      <div className="w-full max-w-md space-y-8">
        <div className="text-center space-y-2">
          <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Create Account</h1>
          <p className="text-gray-400">Join us today and get started</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-900 p-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-800 space-y-6">
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <div className="space-y-2">
              <Label htmlFor="email" className="text-gray-200">
                Email Address
              </Label>
              <Input
                id="email"
                type="email"
                placeholder="Enter your email"
                className="bg-gray-800 border-gray-700 text-white placeholder:text-gray-500 focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-500"
                required
              />
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-2">
              <Label htmlFor="password" className="text-gray-200">
                Password
              </Label>
              <Input
                id="password"
                type="password"
                placeholder="Create a password"
                className="bg-gray-800 border-gray-700 text-white placeholder:text-gray-500 focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-500"
                required
              />
            </div>
          </div>

          <Button
            type="submit"
            className="w-full bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-semibold py-2.5 transition-colors"
          >
            Sign Up Now
          </Button>

          <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-400">
            Already have an account?{" "}
            <a href="#" className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline">
              Sign in
            </a>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This code will render the following UI:

![V0.dev UI](ai-ready-frontend-architecture/v0-dev-ui.png)

V0 integrates perfectly with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), since both are part of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I recommend using this pairing to maximize the throughput of developers and designers, and I think that in the future we'll see even better integrations to leverage the use of custom design systems.

Imagine an AI that’s fully aware of all the components in your design system—and knows exactly when and how to use them. A designer could describe a complex interface in natural language using a tool like V0, and the AI would intelligently assemble it using existing developer-built components when available, or generate new ones only when necessary. This creates a seamless collaboration between design and development, drastically accelerating UI creation while maintaining consistency and code quality.

How would this work? AI tools read:

- `.storybook` for examples
- `.junie/guidelines` for conventions
- `.mdx` files for documentation

**Tools generate. Design systems validate.**

## 2. Use Case Pattern for Agent-Controlled Logic

Frontend generation is only half the story. AI-generated UIs need to call the right domain logic, without coupling to implementation details.

This is where the [Use Case pattern](https://www.cesalberca.com/en/blog/use-cases-and-commands) shines:

```typescript
export interface UseCase<In = unknown, Out = unknown> {
  handle(param?: In, meta?: UseCaseOptions): Promise<Out>
}
```

Every action like RegisterUser, CreatePost, or SubmitFeedback, becomes an injectable use case. It's straightforward to test, extend, and expose.

To run use cases you would use an `UseCaseService`:

```typescript
await useCaseService.execute(RegisterUserUseCase, {
  email: "test@example.com",
  password: "secure-password",
})
```

Why add a useCaseService? It abstracts the execution of use cases, allowing us to centralize cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, permission checks, loading states, and error handling. This pattern becomes powerful when combined with middlewares, enabling modular and reusable behavior around every use case execution.

Decoupling use cases from whoever calls them means that now are architecture is AI ready. How so? Well, now your code doesn't care if the use cases are being triggered by the push of a button or an AI agent. That's the power of decoupling.

### Use Cases in Practice

Let's define one:

```typescript
interface CreatePostDTO {
  title: string
  body: string
  authorId: string
}

export class CreatePostUseCase implements UseCase<CreatePostDTO, Post> {
  constructor(
    private readonly postRepo: PostRepository,
    private readonly slugGenerator: SlugGenerator,
  ) {}

  async handle({ title, body, authorId }: CreatePostDTO): Promise<Post> {
    if (!title || !body) {
      throw new MissingPostContentError('Title and body are required')
    }

    const slug = this.slugGenerator.generate(title)

    const post = Post.create({
      title,
      body,
      slug,
      authorId,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    })

    await this.postRepo.save(post)

    return post
  }
}
```

Let's now see how we can add middlewares.

## 3. Middleware Chains: The Intelligent Layer

Inspired by the [Chain of Responsibility pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility), middleware handles all cross-cutting concerns:

- Logging
- Performance tracing
- Error handling
- Caching

```typescript
interface Middleware {
  execute<In, Out>(
    param: In,
    next: UseCase<In, Out>,
    options: UseCaseOptions
  ): Promise<Out>
}
```

### Middleware Examples

#### Error Middleware

Tired of adding try catch around all your code? You don't need it. You can throw domain errors and let them bubble up so they can be captured automatically with an ErrorMiddleware. The event emitter will dispatch an error event and the interface listens for errors to show a toast to the user.

```typescript
export class ErrorMiddleware implements Middleware {
  constructor(private readonly eventEmitter: EventEmitter) {}

  async intercept(
    params: unknown,
    next: UseCase,
    options: UseCaseOptions,
  ): Promise<unknown> {
    try {
      return await next.handle(params)
    } catch (error) {
      if (!options.silentError) {
        this.eventEmitter.dispatch(EventType.ERROR, error)
      }
      throw error
    }
  }
}
```

#### Log Middleware

With this middleware you can add logs to your app automatically. Since we are using a Logger interface we can run different implementations, like in development use console.log and in production use a remote logging service.

```typescript
export class LogMiddleware implements Middleware {
  constructor(private readonly logger: Logger) {}

  intercept(params: unknown, useCase: UseCase): Promise<unknown> {
    this.logger.log(
      `[${DateTime.fromNow().toISO()}] ${this.getName(useCase)} / ${this.printResult(params)}`,
    )
    return useCase.handle(params)
  }

  private getName(useCase: UseCase): string {
    if (useCase instanceof UseCaseHandler) {
      return this.getName(useCase.useCase)
    }

    return useCase.constructor.name
  }

  private printResult(result: unknown) {
    return JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)
  }
}
```

#### Cache Middleware

Since we can apply CQRS to divide our use cases into commands or queries we can then automatically cache queries and make commands invalidate the cache of queries.

```typescript
import type { Middleware } from './middleware'
import type { UseCase } from '../use-case'
import type { UseCaseOptions } from '../use-case-options'

type CacheEntry = {
  value: unknown
  expiresAt: number
}

export class CacheMiddleware implements Middleware {
  private readonly store = new Map<string, CacheEntry>()

  constructor(private readonly ttlInSeconds: number = 60) {}

  async intercept<In, Out>(
    params: In,
    next: UseCase<In, Out>,
    options: UseCaseOptions,
  ): Promise<Out> {
    const key = options.cacheKey
    if (!key) {
      return next.handle(params, options)
    }

    const now = Date.now()
    const cached = this.store.get(key)

    if (cached && now < cached.expiresAt) {
      return cached.value as Out
    }

    const result = await next.handle(params, options)
    this.store.set(key, {
      value: result,
      expiresAt: now + this.ttlInSeconds * 1000,
    })

    return result
  }
}
```

### Composing Middlewares

To piece middlewares together we add them to the UseCaseService:

```typescript
export class UseCaseService {
  constructor(
    private middlewares: Middleware[],
    private readonly container: Container,
  ) {}

  async execute<In, Out>(
    useCase: Type<UseCase<In, Out>>,
    param?: In,
    options?: UseCaseOptions,
  ): Promise<Out> {
    const requiredOptions = options ?? {
      silentError: false,
    }

    let next = UseCaseHandler.create({
      next: this.container.create(useCase),
      options: requiredOptions,
      middleware: this.container.get<EmptyMiddleware>(EmptyMiddleware.name),
    })

    for (let i = this.middlewares.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      const currentMiddleware = this.middlewares[i]
      const previous = next
      next = UseCaseHandler.create({
        next: previous,
        middleware: currentMiddleware,
        options: requiredOptions,
      })
    }

    return next.handle(param) as Promise<Out>
  }
}
```

Now your architecture can support:

- Error handling
- Logging
- Caching

And you don't need to touch the use case logic itself.
