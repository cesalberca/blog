  summary: 'A mobile application that offers three carefully selected new people to meet every Friday, focusing on authentic and intentional social connections.',
}

## Summary

**Problem**: Tabaiba needed to build a mobile application with a complex onboarding flow that would collect essential user information without being overwhelming, while ensuring maintainability and flexibility for future iterations.

**Solution**: Implemented a Domain-Driven Design approach with a feature-based architecture, using design patterns like Template Method, Domain Model, Command, Observer, and Composite to create a clean, maintainable codebase.

**Result**: Delivered a well-crafted solution with a flexible and maintainable architecture that provides a natural and engaging user experience.

## The Story Behind Tabaiba

In a world where social connections often feel **superficial** and **dopamine-driven**, [Tabaiba](https://tabaiba.me) emerges as a breath of fresh air. The concept is simple yet powerful: instead of endlessly swiping through profiles, users would receive three carefully selected connections through matching algorithms every Friday. This approach resonated deeply with me—it felt **authentic**, **intentional**, and **human**.

## The Challenge

Building a mobile application that could deliver this experience required more than just programming skills. It needed an approach based on [Domain-Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) and a [feature-based architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRns0rqPonA).

## The Technical Journey

### Architecture and Structure

The implementation focused on creating a structure that reflected the problem domain. We organized the code into independent modules, each representing a specific application capability:

```typescript
core/
  ├── onboarding/           # Onboarding feature
  │   ├── application/      # Use cases and state management
  │   ├── domain/          # Domain models and interfaces
  │   ├── infrastructure/  # Repository implementations and coupled code
  │   └── delivery/        # UI Components
  ├── auth/                # Authentication feature
  └── i18n/               # Internationalization
```

This structure wasn't just about organization—it was about creating a **clear mental model** that would guide us through the development process.

### Design Patterns

Onboarding is one of the most critical moments in the user experience. We needed to solve several challenges:

- **Flow Complexity**: The process had to collect essential user information without being overwhelming
- **Flexibility**: Some steps needed to be mandatory while others optional, allowing users to customize their experience
- **Maintainability**: The flow needed to be easy to modify, as we expected to iterate based on user feedback
- **State**: We needed to robustly manage user progress, allowing them to resume where they left off
- **User Experience**: Navigation needed to be intuitive, with clear options to advance, go back, or skip steps

To address these challenges, we implemented several [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) that provided us with an elegant and scalable solution:

#### [Template Method Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method)

This pattern allows us to define the "skeleton" of an algorithm in a method, delegating some steps to subclasses. In our case, the base onboarding component provides a common structure for all steps, giving us several advantages:

- **Visual Consistency**: All steps maintain the same structure and style
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Common navigation and layout logic is defined once
- **Flexibility**: Each step can customize its content while maintaining the common structure
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the base structure automatically apply to all steps

```typescript
interface StepProps extends PropsWithChildren {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  className?: string;
  onNext: () => void;
  onBack?: () => void;
  onSkip?: () => void;
  isOptional?: boolean;
}

export const BaseStep: FC<StepProps> = ({
  title,
  description,
  children,
  onNext,
  onBack,
  onSkip,
  isOptional = false,
}) => {
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 justify-between p-4">
      <View className="flex-1">
        <Text className="text-2xl font-bold">{title}</Text>
        <Text className="text-gray-600 mt-2">{description}</Text>
        <View className="mt-8">{children}</View>
      </View>

      <View className="flex-row justify-between items-center">
        <Button onPress={onBack} variant="ghost">
          {t('common.back')}
        </Button>

        <View className="flex-row gap-2">
          {isOptional && (
            <Button onPress={onSkip} variant="ghost">
              {t('common.skip')}
            </Button>
          )}
          <Button onPress={onNext}>
            {t('common.next')}
          </Button>
        </View>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};
```

#### [Domain Model Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html)

The domain model is the heart of our application. Following DDD principles and the [Repository Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/repository), we encapsulate all business logic in rich domain objects that:

- **Ensure Integrity**: Business rules are consistently applied
- **Are Self-Validating**: The model itself ensures data validity
- **Provide a Clear API**: Methods clearly express allowed operations
- **Are Immutable**: Preventing unwanted side effects

```typescript
interface OnboardingStatus {
  completedSteps: StepId[]
  isFullyCompleted: boolean
  getNextStep(): StepId | null
}

interface OnboardingStatusValue {
  data: OnboardingData;
  completedSteps: StepId[];
  skippedSkippableSteps: boolean;
  requiredStepsCompleted: boolean;
  skippableStepsCompleted: boolean;
  lastCompletedStep: StepId | null;
}

export class OnboardingStatus extends ValueObject<OnboardingStatusValue> {
  static create(params: OnboardingStatusValue): OnboardingStatus {
    return new OnboardingStatus(params);
  }

  toPrimitives(): OnboardingStatusValue {
    return {
      data: this.value.data,
      completedSteps: this.value.completedSteps,
      skippedSkippableSteps: this.value.skippedSkippableSteps,
      requiredStepsCompleted: this.value.requiredStepsCompleted,
      skippableStepsCompleted: this.value.skippableStepsCompleted,
      lastCompletedStep: this.value.lastCompletedStep,
    };
  }

  isFullyCompleted(): boolean {
    return this.value.requiredStepsCompleted && this.value.skippableStepsCompleted;
  }

  isRequiredCompleted(): boolean {
    return this.value.requiredStepsCompleted;
  }

  hasSkippedSkippableSteps(): boolean {
    return this.value.skippedSkippableSteps;
  }

  getCompletedSteps(): StepId[] {
    return this.value.completedSteps;
  }

  getData(): OnboardingData {
    return this.value.data;
  }
}
```

#### [Command Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command) and [Observer Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)

The application layer acts as an orchestrator between the UI and domain. We use custom hooks and the Command pattern to:

- **Separate Responsibilities**: Business logic is separated from the UI
- **Improve Testability**: Each command can be tested in isolation
- **Facilitate Reuse**: Hooks encapsulate complex logic that can be reused
- **Manage State**: In a predictable and centralized way

```typescript
export function useOnboarding() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const onboardingRepository = container.resolve<OnboardingRepository>(
    InjectionTokens.ONBOARDING_REPOSITORY
  );
  const [onboardingStatus, setOnboardingStatus] = useState<OnboardingStatus | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    loadOnboardingStatus();
  }, []);

  const loadOnboardingStatus = async () => {
    const status = await onboardingRepository.getOnboardingStatus();
    setOnboardingStatus(status);

    if (!pathname?.includes('onboarding')) {
      if (!status.isRequiredCompleted()) {
        router.push('/onboarding/required');
      } else if (status.isFullyCompleted()) {
        router.push('/(tabs)');
      }
    }
  };

  const completeRequiredOnboarding = useCallback(async () => {
    await onboardingRepository.completeRequiredOnboarding();
  }, [onboardingRepository]);

  const completeOptionalOnboarding = useCallback(async () => {
    await onboardingRepository.completeOnboarding();
    router.push('/(tabs)');
  }, [onboardingRepository, router]);

  return {
    onboardingStatus,
    completeRequiredOnboarding,
    completeOptionalOnboarding,
  };
}

@injectable()
export class SetNameCommand implements Command<SetNameParams, void> {
  constructor(
    @inject(InjectionTokens.ONBOARDING_REPOSITORY)
    private readonly onboardingRepository: OnboardingRepository
  ) {}

  async handle(params: SetNameParams): Promise<void> {
    await this.onboardingRepository.updateOnboardingStep(STEP_IDS.NAME, { name: params.name });
  }
}
```

#### [Composite Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)

UI components are built following the principle of controlled and decoupled components, using the Composite pattern to create hierarchical component structures. This approach provides us with:

- **Reusable Components**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Makes code more predictable and easier to debug
- **Separation of Concerns**: Presentation logic is separated from business logic
- **Better Development Experience**: Components are easy to understand and modify

```typescript
export const RequiredOnboarding: FC = () => {
  const { completeRequiredOnboarding } = useOnboarding();
  const [currentStepIndex, setCurrentStepIndex] = useState(0);

  const handleNext = () => {
    if (currentStepIndex === 0) {
      completeRequiredOnboarding();
      setCurrentStepIndex(currentStepIndex + 1);
    }
  };

  const handleBack = () => {
    setCurrentStepIndex(currentStepIndex - 1);
  };

  const steps = [<NameStep key="name" />, <ContinueOrSkipStep key="continueOrSkip" />];

  return (
    <Page>
      <Wizard
        currentStepIndex={currentStepIndex}
        onNext={handleNext}
        onBack={handleBack}
        nextLabel={t(currentStepIndex === 0 ? 'common.next' : 'common.complete')}
        backLabel={t('common.back')}
        showBackButton={!isTransitionStep}
        hideDefaultButtons={isTransitionStep}>
        {steps}
      </Wizard>
    </Page>
  );
};

export const NameStep: FC = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const useCase = container.resolve(UseCaseService);

  const handleNameChange = async (value: string) => {
    setName(value);
    await updateProfile(value);
  };

  const updateProfile = async (name: string) => {
    useCase.execute(SetNameCommand, { name });
  };

  return (
    <BaseStep title="What's your name?" description="Let us know how we should call you">
      <View className="space-y-4">
        <TextInput
          className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg"
          placeholder="Your name"
          value={name}
          onChangeText={handleNameChange}
        />
      </View>
    </BaseStep>
  );
};
```
