In this talk we'll see how to unit test our code. Although we'll be using Jest and JavaScript, the concepts we'll see you can apply to any other language or testing framework. We'll deepen our knowledge on how to make good tests, from the test definition to the strategies to follow to make our test more robust and long-lived. We'll see concepts like F.I.R.S.T, given when then, TDD, mocking and... Much more!
