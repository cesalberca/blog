There are too many talks about how to develop Good React Applications™️. However, creating a convoluted hierarchy of React Components that don't make any sense requires discipline, perfectionism, and a high level of dedication and craftsmanship. In this talk you will learn to create effects that, will make your view re-render hundreds if not thousands of time, you will learn how to create components so big that will remind you of Angular and you will introduce so much state into your projects that your teammates will question why they chose programming as a career. Join this talk and let's create React Code together that would make a goat vomit!
