Deno is said to be by many the successor of Node, including the creator of both: Ryan Dahl, who using the knowledge obtained from Node's 10 year lifespan started this project in order to fix some of the errors, which he mentions in the [talk where he introduced Deno to the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA).

Node was very disruptive in the tech world, but back then JavaScript was not what it is today. Many things didn't exist then, like promises, ESModules, binary data and many other APIs that are standard now. So Node had to innovate in these areas. But now that there are many standard APIs that solve these problems Node has had problems adapting, as it would have meant that there would be very big breaking changes.

Moreover, Deno has native TypeScript support —which means that we don't need to compile a TypeScript file in order to run it—, a security model, a decentralized solution to distribute packages, a single executable and many more things.
