AI, please write an abstract for my talk: AI-ready Frontend Architecture. I want to explain how I'm reshaping my Frontend stack so it works not just for humans, but also for AI agents. You know, those tools that generate UIs, call logic, and sometimes break everything when they don't follow the rules.

In the talk, I'll walk through the architecture I'm using—component-driven UIs, the use case pattern, and middleware chains—to make the system predictable, scalable, and friendly to both developers and AI. I'll show how tools fit in, and how setting clear conventions makes everything smoother.

Make sure to say that I'm a Freelance Senior Frontend Architect and Digital Nomad. Make it in 739 characters and give me 5 options. Please.
