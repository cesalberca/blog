  notes:
    "This is a fun and sarcastic talk where I give specific tips and examples on how to create bad Software. It's a satire, so during all the talk I'm serious. It's an easy-going talk where I mix comedy and programming to teach some valuable lessons.",
}

There are too many talks about how to develop good software. However, creating bad software requires discipline, perfectionism, and a high level of dedication and craftsmanship. In this talk you will learn to create code that, when modified, will break parts of the application that seemingly have no connection. You will introduce so much entropy into projects that your teammates will question why they chose programming as a career. Join this talk and let's create software together that would make a goat vomit!
