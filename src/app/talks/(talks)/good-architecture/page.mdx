Are you sick of architecture talks where they show you nice graphs (üìä) but no code? Talks where they teach you SOLID, layers and ‚Äìfor an unseemingly weird reason‚Äì onions but they don't go deeper? Want to know how to apply architecture to the crazy world of the frontend, but you don't know why? If that is the case, this is your talk. We'll review at a technical level what makes up a good architecture, good practices‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and loads and loads go code with TypeScript and Vue. Batteries not included.

export default function Page({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout slug="good-architecture">{children}</MdxLayout>
