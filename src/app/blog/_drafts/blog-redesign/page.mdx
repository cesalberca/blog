I recently became a Freelancer as a Digital Nomad traveling the world. I had a website already but it was not good enough. If I wanted to offer my services as a Front-end Software Architect I needed to showcase what I'm capable of doing. So I updated from Next.js 11 to Next.js 14, using it's new app directory. While at it I added the following technologies for this project:

- <ScrambleText>TaildwindCSS</ScrambleText>
- <ScrambleText>ShadcnUI</ScrambleText>
- <ScrambleText>Framer Motion</ScrambleText>
- <ScrambleText>MDX</ScrambleText>
- <ScrambleText>Next Intl</ScrambleText>
- <ScrambleText>Zod</ScrambleText>
- <ScrambleText>React Hook Forms</ScrambleText>

I used [Next.js' starter porfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) to have a good SEO base. I tweaked the architecture and configured the project as I usually do, with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

I decided to focus on creating a clean design with a big focus on content and some subtle animations. Can you guess which one I'm referring to?

I also spent some time tweaking what I call the `LeetBackground` animation.

<LeetBackground><div className="p-xl">Hello world!</div></LeetBackground>

At some point I would like to synchronize it with the scroll events.

## MDX

As you can see, all the components that I'm developing for the website I can reuse them in the blog posts and that's thanks to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). In MDX you can import React components, which is a powerful thing to do. For example:

```jsx
<LeetBackground><div className="p-xl">Hello world!</div></LeetBackground>
```

I started to configure the project following [Next.js MDX guide](https://Next.js.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) but found myself using [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support) but found a little bit overcomplicated and found [this amazing post](https://www.alexchantastic.com/building-a-blog-with-next-and-mdx) which showed how to simplify the setup using [next-mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx) (which is the official Next.js tooling for MDX).

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout slug="blog-redesign">{children}</MdxLayout>
}
