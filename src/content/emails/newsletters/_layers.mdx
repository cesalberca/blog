I've implemented this pattern countless times in projects **ranging from Startups** to **Multi Million and international companies**. I've perfected over a _decade_ how I implement this pattern and in this newsletter I want to show _you_.`

In [the previous issue of this Newsletter](https://cesalberca.com/newsletter/2025-10-13_the-use-case-pattern) we talked about Use Cases. In the example that I used you could see what it looked like a class being used:

```typescript
export class GetDestinationsQry implements UseCase<void, Destination[]> {
  constructor(
    private readonly destinationRepository: DestinationRepository,
    private readonly destinationOrderer: DestinationOrderer,
  ) {}

  async handle(): Promise<Destination[]> {
    return this.destinationOrderer.order(await this.destinationRepository.findAll())
  }
}
```

Well, it's not a class! Let me explain why.

## The Repository Pattern

Have you ever interacted with data? Perhaps getting data from a database, making an API call using fetch or maybe writing data in-memory. Well, that's a Repository!

> A Repository represents a piece of code that interacts with data

In some places you might have seen it called `Services`. However, for me, service is a tad too generic, everything could be a service! I prefer being more specific about the intention behind the pieces of code that I use.
