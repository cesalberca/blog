# How I Use the Bullet Journal Method to Stay Organized

As a **freelancer and digital nomad**, staying organized is essential to my productivity and peace of mind. After trying countless digital tools and apps, I found myself returning to an analog system that has transformed how I work and live: **the [Bullet Journal method](https://bulletjournal.com/)**.

## What is the Bullet Journal Method?

The Bullet Journal (or BuJo for short) is an analog organization system created by [Ryder Carroll](https://www.rydercarroll.com/). It's a customizable and forgiving system that can work for anyone, regardless of how organized (or disorganized) you naturally are.

> The Bullet Journal method is about the art of intentional living.

At its core, the Bullet Journal method is a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system. It's designed to help you:

- Track the past
- Organize the present
- Plan for the future

## My Bullet Journal Setup

My journal setup has evolved over the 8 months I've been doing it to fit my specific needs as a freelancer who travels frequently. Here's how I structure mine:

### 1. Legend

The legend is the key to understanding your Bullet Journal. It shows all the symbols and their meanings, making it easy to quickly scan your journal and understand what each entry represents. I keep mine simple with the core symbols, but you can customize yours with additional signifiers that make sense for your specific needs.

![Bullet Journal Legend](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/legend.jpg)

I found useful to add symbols for objectives, mark collections with a triangle and using a plus symbol to make a note about a thought I might want to expand later on.

### 1. Index

Every Bullet Journal starts with an index. This is simply a table of contents that helps you find information quickly. I update this as I add new collections or important pages.

![Bullet Journal Legend](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/index.jpg)

If a collection spans multiple pages, you can do the following:

Bullet Journaling: 15-16, 18-19

Which means that the trip to Bullet Journaling goes from page 15 to 16 and then again from page 18 to 19. You can also mark in the bottom of the page 16 of the collection a slash and indicate what page it continues to, in this case it would be 16/18. And you can do the same for the page 18, so it would be 16/18.

The index works since the journal I have has numbered pages, so I recommend you buy a notebook that has this feature. Right now I'm using the [official one](https://bullet-journal.eu/bullet-journal-edition-2.html) since it's very well-designed for its task.

### 2. Future Log

The future log is a calendar that spans several months. I use it to note important days I want to remember that have already happened. Each month I move days I want to remember here to have an easy overview of the year. I also mark in red birthdays.

### 3. Monthly Log

![Complete Monthly Log](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/monthly-log.jpg)

The monthly log is the heart of my Bullet Journal system. It gives me a bird's-eye view of the month and helps me plan and track my progress. A well-designed monthly log combines calendar elements with space for goals, tasks, and habit tracking.

At the beginning of each month, I create:

* A monthly calendar
* A task list for the month
* Monthly goals
* Habit tracker

![Empty Monthly Log](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/empty-monthly-log.jpg)

This is how I set up my monthly log at the beginning of each month. I start with a clean spread that includes dates down the left side and space for notes on the right. Each day I write down the highlight of the day.

I also add the days of the week and a horizontal bar to separate each week.

![Monthly Log with Objectives](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/monthly-log-objectives.jpg)

For each month, I set specific objectives that I want to accomplish. Writing these down at the beginning of the month helps me stay focused on what matters most and gives me a clear target to work toward.

My habit tracker is one of the most valuable parts of my Bullet Journal. I track daily habits like meditation, exercise, reading, and water intake. The visual representation makes it satisfying to fill in each day and helps me identify patterns in my behavior.

![Monthly Log Day Tracking](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/monthly-log-day-tracking.jpg)


At the end of the month, my completed monthly log becomes a record of what I've accomplished. I can see which habits I maintained consistently, which goals I achieved, and where I might need to focus more attention in the coming month.


![Monthly Log with Tracking](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/monthly-log-tracked.jpg)

For more detailed day tracking, I use this format to monitor specific activities or metrics throughout the month. Each row represents a different activity or metric I want to track, and each column represents a day of the month. This visual approach helps me spot trends and patterns that might not be obvious otherwise.

This is how a complete month looks like:

![Complete Monthly Log](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/monthly-log.jpg)

In a simple glance I can see the following:

1. Highlights of each day
2. How I felt during the month and how it's linked to each day
3. Objectives of the month and if I completed them
4. Habits I completed
5. Has my work and personal time felt satisfying?

### 4. Weekly Spreads

This is where the magic happens for me. Each week gets a page spread with:

* Daily task lists
* Weekly priorities
* Weekly objectives

![Empty Weekly Log](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/empty-weekly-log.jpg)

I start each week with a blank weekly spread like this. The clean slate gives me a chance to reflect on what's ahead and how I want to structure my week. I typically set this up on Sunday evenings as part of my weekly planning ritual.

![Weekly Log](/assets/images/posts/bullet-journal-method/weekly-log.jpg)

Here's what my weekly log looks like after I've filled it in. I divide each day into sections for tasks, appointments, and notes. The left side contains my weekly priorities and goals, while the right pages are dedicated to daily entries. This layout gives me both the big picture view of my week and the detailed daily planning I need.

Within my weekly spread, I create detailed daily logs. Each day gets its own section where I track tasks, events, and notes using the bullet journal syntax. I leave space for rapid logging throughout the day and often add small notes or observations that help me remember what happened. At the end of the day, I review what I've completed and migrate any unfinished tasks.

### 5. Daily log

### 5. Collections

Collections are pages dedicated to specific topics. Some of my regular collections include:

- **Project Logs**: One page per client project to track progress, ideas, and notes
- **Content Ideas**: Blog post and talk ideas that come to mind
- **Reading Log**: Books I've read or want to read
- **Travel Plans**: Details for upcoming trips
- **Habit Tracker**: Visual representation of my daily habits

## The Bullet Journal Syntax

The core of the Bullet Journal method is its simple notation system:

<Background>
  <div className="p-m">
    <ul>
      <li>• Task (a simple bullet)</li>
      <li>x Completed task</li>
      <li>> Migrated task (moved to another day/week)</li>
      <li>< Scheduled task (moved to the future log)</li>
      <li>- Note (simple information)</li>
      <li>○ Event (something that happened)</li>
      <li>▵ Collection</li>
      <li>+ Expand thought</li>
      <li>= Emotion</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</Background>

This simple syntax allows me to quickly capture information throughout the day without breaking my flow.

## Why the Bullet Journal Works for Me

As someone who works with digital tools all day, there's something refreshing about stepping away from screens and using pen and paper. Here's why I find it so effective:

1. **Mindfulness**: The act of writing by hand forces me to slow down and be more intentional about what I include.

2. **Flexibility**: Unlike pre-printed planners or rigid apps, I can adapt my journal to my changing needs.

3. **Reduced Digital Distractions**: When I open a digital app to add a task, I often get distracted by notifications. With my journal, there's no risk of falling into a social media rabbit hole.

4. **Better Memory Retention**: Research shows that writing by hand improves memory and understanding compared to typing.

5. **Satisfaction**: There's a unique satisfaction in physically crossing off completed tasks.

## Digital Complements

While I love my analog journal, I do use some digital tools alongside it:

<Link to="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</Link> for scheduling meetings and time-specific events

<Link to="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</Link> for collaborative project documentation

<Link to="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</Link> for document storage

The key is finding the right balance between analog and digital tools that works for your specific needs.

## Getting Started with Bullet Journaling

If you're interested in trying the Bullet Journal method, here's my advice:

1. **Start simple**: Don't try to create an elaborate system right away. Begin with the basics: index, future log, monthly log, and daily logs.

2. **Forget perfection**: Your journal doesn't need to look Instagram-worthy. Focus on functionality first.

3. **Experiment**: Try different layouts and collections to see what works for you.

4. **Be consistent**: Make journaling a daily habit, even if it's just for a few minutes.

5. **Adapt**: The beauty of the Bullet Journal is that you can change it as you go. If something isn't working, try a different approach.

## Conclusion

The Bullet Journal method has become an essential part of my productivity system as a freelancer and digital nomad. It helps me stay organized, focused, and mindful in a world full of distractions.

What I love most about this method is that it's not just about getting things done—it's about intentionally deciding what's worth doing in the first place.
