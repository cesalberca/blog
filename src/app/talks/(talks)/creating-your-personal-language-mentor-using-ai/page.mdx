As a Digital Nomad, my life is filled with new languages, cultures, and challenges. As a Software Developer I'm always looking for ways to automate and improve my life on the go. Traditional language learning apps never quite worked for me—they felt too rigid and didn't adapt to what I really needed. So, I decided to create my own solution using Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In this talk, I’ll share how I built a custom language learning assistant using GPTs within ChatGPT, tailored to fit my unique way of learning. I’ll walk you through the process, from the initial idea to actually making it work, and show you how you can build your own AI-powered language tutor. Whether you’re navigating new places, passionate about tech, or just excited to learn something new, you’ll walk away with the tools and inspiration to create your personal language mentor using AI.
