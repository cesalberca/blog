      "frameworks": {
        "question": "What frameworks do you specialize in?",
        "answer": "I have extensive experience with React (5+ years), Angular (4+ years), and Vue (2+ years). However, my architectural expertise transcends specific frameworks, focusing on patterns and practices that can be applied across technologies."
      },
      "knowledgeTransfer": {
        "question": "How do you handle knowledge transfer?",
        "answer": "Knowledge transfer is built into my process. I provide comprehensive documentation, conduct training sessions, and offer post-project support to ensure your team fully understands the implemented architecture and can maintain it independently."
      },
      "approach": {
        "question": "What makes your architectural approach different?",
        "answer": "My approach combines Domain-Driven Design with Hexagonal Architecture to create systems that are both business-aligned and technically robust. I focus on creating clear boundaries between your core domain and external dependencies, making your codebase more maintainable and adaptable to change."
      },
      "existingCodebase": {
        "question": "Can you help with an existing codebase?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. I specialize in refactoring and improving existing codebases. I'll analyze your current architecture, identify pain points, and create a strategic plan to incrementally improve your system without disrupting ongoing development. This approach allows you to gradually adopt better practices while continuing to deliver business value."
      },
      "ongoingSupport": {
        "question": "Do you offer ongoing support after project completion?",
        "answer": "Yes, I offer flexible support options after the initial engagement. This can include code reviews, architecture guidance for new features, or regular check-ins to ensure your team is following the established patterns. My goal is to ensure long-term success, not just deliver a solution and walk away."
      },
      "projectTime": {
        "question": "How long does a typical project take?",
        "answer": "Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. Consultations typically range from 2-4 weeks, while full development projects may take 3-6 months. I'll provide a detailed timeline during our initial consultation."

      "paragraph1": "This book has reached you for a very specific reason: the code you write is... _Terrible_. _Shameful_. _Offensive_. **And on top of that, it's in JavaScript**. So yes, this book is for you. So that you keep writing code that only _\"works\"_ on your local machine and nobody knows why. **Because if nobody understands your code... You're indispensable**.",
      "paragraph2": "With this book you'll learn to create **undetectable _bugs_**, **infinite recursive nested loops**, code structures that are **illegal in 42 countries**, abstractions that only **a lizard would understand** and functions that return anxiety.",
      "paragraph3": "In short, you'll reinforce your mastery in **writing code that would make a goat vomit** to become an authentic development brute: a **\"Software Cafrer\"**. And yes, it's a good gift for that person who does _\"that thing\"_ with computers and you don't like _that_ much."

I'm very interested in **architecture**, **best practices**, **testing** and creating _Frontend_ applications that **survive the terrible pieces of code you make**. Yes, _you_, the one reading this. You know _perfectly_ well that you've been making code that would knock down a wildebeest for years. When are you going to stop?",
      "paragraph2": "Meanwhile, I continue with my thing, promoting job intrusion by giving technical talks about architecture in the _Frontend_ —also called **architecturras™**—, traveling beyond my means as a **digital nomad**, and accumulating hobbies in the hope of forgetting that, _indeed_, **I still program for a living**.",
