The famous and prolific novelist [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway) came up with a mechanism to avoid writer's block. When he was about to finish a writing session, he would leave some room to **write down his next steps**, noting the point where he had left off, his **major obstacles** or difficulties in wrapping up a plot, or the most important **open question to be resolved**.

The idea is to provide multiple starting points for your _future self_, making it as easy as possible to pick up where you left off. This way of building bridges to the future is a very smart way to work, and you can even **apply it to coding**.

Instead of ending your programming session with a clean `git status` or all tests in green, you can try to **conclude your session with a failing test** for the next feature or refactor you want to tackle. This way, regaining context and focus will be easier when you return to it.
